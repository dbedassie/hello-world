# hello-world

Hi! My name is Durrell.

I am a second-year Game Design and Development student at RIT. I am also an Ambassador for the School of Interactive Games and Media.
From Jamaica, Queens (New York City), I plan to make video games with the purpose of bringing friends together, whether it be friends
next door, or friends across the globe. Video games are a fun and amazing way to meet/connect with people from anywhere at anytime.

EDIT: THIS WAS PART OF THE "hello-world" TUTORIAL. THIS REPO IS NOW RENAMED IGME230.
